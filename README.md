# Tell Me I Cheat Now!

_Go ahead, tell me I cheat now! **You won't!**_

## Description

This library is designed to help with validating that the player is not cheating when confronted with a client-side
anti-cheat check.

### Disclaimer

With this library, we are not encouraging cheating, nor we provide a way to do so.
We are simply providing a way to communicate with the server-side code that is responsible for the anti-cheat check.

## Supported Servers
